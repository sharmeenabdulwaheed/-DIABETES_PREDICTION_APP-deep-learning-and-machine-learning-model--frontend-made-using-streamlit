# -DIABETES_PREDICTION_APP-deep-learning-and-machine-learning-model--frontend-made-using-streamlit
This app takes diabetes prediction to the next level by using multiple machine learning models like Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM to find the most accurate one. Instead of just telling if a person has diabetes or not, it also provides the percentage of how likely they are to have or be susceptible to diabetes using logistic regression probability

We’ve also included a powerful deep learning model to make predictions even more reliable. On top of that, the app features a simple and interactive front-end built with Streamlit, making it easy for anyone to use and understand. Explore the project and find out how AI can help in health predictions!
